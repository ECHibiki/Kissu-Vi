Any action deemed to be unfair to the userbase of this site shall be removed and penalties applied as listed. </li> <ul><li>These are the current list of unfair behaviour and their justifications as well as penalties:</li><ol><li>/r9k/ mascots such as frogs and wojacks.<ul><li>These images serve as clickbait to get the most reactions. This is unfair to users who want to post less obtrusive imagery and stifle the creative spirit of imageboards. </li><li>Permaban no exception</li></ul></li><li>Content who's sole purpose can be seen as being used for pedophilic entertainment.<ul><li>Getting this site shut down for your own entertainment is unfair to the users of this site</li><li>Deletions unless  law infringing in which case permaban</li></ul></li><li>Moderators acting in such a way that it makes their life easier but makes it unfair to others trying to go about their business.<ul><li>A moderator shouldn't act in such a way that it makes her life easier. The saying"Remember: The use of 4chan is a privilege, not a right. The 4chan moderation team reserves the right to revoke access and remove content for any reason without notice." is not in effect here.</li><li>Moderator sacked</li></ul></li><li>Certain other ideas that haven't become a problem yet are tribalist politics that seek to put everyone into a camp. Nudity in undesignated areas. Unwelcome content on boards. Not all of these may warrant deletions, but in some cases the creation of more boards and sub-communities in order to make sure that everyone(in principle at least) is happy</li></ol></ul></li><li>Given a scenario or tool where acting in fairness as a principle will cause the loss of fairness to others by nature of the website or Internet's limitations, the infringing content will be subject to regulations or prohibitions until a more adequate system has been made. This in effect treats a scenario of lack of fairness for her website as a bug that must be remedied<ul><li>Current Issues are: <ol><li>Proxy, VPN and Tor posting require more moderation on the website in order to maintain that the above rules are not broken and given a free pass at any time of day. Until Vichan's tools are updated these are regulated and permabanned if spotted.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><hr/>The above are considered the standard fare for this website's operation, however since this website is inspired by the persuit of fairness users will eventually(.......soon...) be allowed to vote on new rules and have a say in how the moderation of this site works. The implementation of this idea is up for debate, however it will be done through a poll that allows you to vote only if you have a certain number of posts on this site. <br/>While there are certain exploits that may be done here to rig voting these should be handled as they appear<br/><br/>Verniy ## Admin</div><hr><footer><p class="unimportant" style="margin-top:20px;text-align:center;">- Tinyboard + <a href="https://engine.vichan.net/">vichan</a> 5.1.4 -<br>Tinyboard Copyright &copy; 2010-2014 Tinyboard Development Group    <br><a href="https://engine.vichan.net/">vichan</a> Copyright &copy; 2012-2018 vichan-devel</p></footer></body></html>
